This project is the back-end for a "Where's Waldo?" game application. It is built using the Ruby on Rails framework.

The "Where's Waldo?" project primarily demonstrates integration of a front-end interface with a back-end API.

The front-end repository can be found [here](https://github.com/xsherryhe/wheres-waldo).
